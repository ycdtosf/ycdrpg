## Object Model

<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:500px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=ycdrpg.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1bbdEhfxDGeK8xN4lKr3awgxZ4ZwbDdal%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

### Character
Jim the Wizard. Kathy the Conjurer. Ed, Raiser of the Dead. You get the idea. Characters can play multiple games over time. Or maybe at the same time... somehow. Magic and stuff.

### Game
How Quests and Characters come together. In D&D, I think this is would be called a "Campaign"? But, that felt like a reserved word in Salesforce.

### GameCharacter
Associates a Character with a Game.

### Quest
A mission / level / challenge / something in a Game that takes characters down a path to fight Monsters, find Items, and generally move the Game forward.

### GameQuest
Associates a Quest with a Game.

### GameQuestStep
Defines a "Step" in a Quest in a Game. We'll talk more today :)
