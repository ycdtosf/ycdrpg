# YCDRPG

YCDRPG is role-playing game engine built on Salesforce. 

## Classes

### GetNthCollectionItemIvocable
When passed a `List<sObject>` and an `index`, returns the Nth record in this List. This makes life a little easier vs. loops in Flows that evaluate indexes.

### GetRandomNumberInvocable
This Invocable Action accepts "min" and "max" parameters and returns a random value between them in decimal form (using  `Math.random()`)

## Flows

Many of the 

### New Game
Inits a new Game by selecting 1+ characters. Calls [New Game Quest](#new-game-quest)

### New Game Quest

### New Game Quest Step

### New Game Quest Monster

## Objects

### Character
Jim the Wizard. Kathy the Conjurer. Ed, Raiser of the Dead. You get the idea. Characters can play multiple games over time. Or maybe at the same time... somehow. Magic and stuff.

### Game
How Quests and Characters come together. In D&D, I think this is would be called a "Campaign"? But, that felt like a reserved word in Salesforce.

### GameCharacter
Associates a Character with a Game.

### GameQuestStep
Represents a Step in a Game Quest.

### GameQuestStepRound
Represents a Round of battle between Players and Monsters.

### GameQuestStepRoundTurn
Represents a Turn within a Round of battle between Characters and Monsters.

### Monster
An enemy that will be faced in the steps of a Game Quest.

### Quest
A mission / level / challenge / something in a Game that takes characters down a path to fight Monsters, find Items, and generally move the Game forward.
